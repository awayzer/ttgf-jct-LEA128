## How it works

This design implements the LEA128 cryptographic algorithm according to the developers’ original paper [1]
and is based on the ideas proposed in [2] and [3] for an area-efficient implementation.

The design was developed as part of an undergraduate academic project, and employs a straightforward (naïve) hardware implementation approach.

The design supports both encryption and decryption operations using a very simple handshake-based byte interface.

Internally, the module receives:

* a 128-bit master key (16 bytes)
* a 128-bit data block (16 bytes)

The bytes are loaded serially through `ui_in` using an input handshake protocol.

After all bytes are loaded:

* `uio_in[3]` starts encryption
* `uio_in[4]` starts decryption

The processed output block is then transmitted byte-by-byte through `uo_out` using an output handshake protocol.

## Pin usage

| Pin           | Function                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ui_in[7:0]`  | Input byte bus                  |
| `uo_out[7:0]` | Output byte bus                 |
| `uio_in[0]`   | request (input handshake)       |
| `uio_in[1]`   | request (output handshake)      |
| `uio_in[2]`   | acknowledge (output handshake)  |
| `uio_in[3]`   | Start encryption                |
| `uio_in[4]`   | Start decryption                |
| `uio_out[6]`  | valid (output handshake)        |
| `uio_out[7]`  | acknowledge (input handshake)   |

The remaining bidirectional pins are unused.

## Input protocol

To send a byte into the design:

1. Place the byte on `ui_in`.
2. Set `uio_in[0]` high.
3. Wait until `uio_out[7]` becomes high.
4. Clear `uio_in[0]`.
5. Wait until `uio_out[7]` returns low.

The first 16 transmitted bytes are interpreted as the encryption key.
The next 16 transmitted bytes are interpreted as the input data block.

## Output protocol

To receive the plaintext/ciphertext from the design:

1. Set `uio_in[1]` high.
2. Wait until `uio_out[6]` becomes high.
3. Read the byte from `uo_out`.
4. Pulse `uio_in[2]` high .
5. after repeating for all 16 bytes, Clear `uio_in[1]`.

The output block is transmitted one byte at a time.

## How to test

**The test vector was sourced from Wikipedia.** [4]

### Encryption test

1. Reset the design by setting `rst_n` low.
2. Send the following 16-byte key:

```text id="k1"
0f 1e 2d 3c 4b 5a 69 78
87 96 a5 b4 c3 d2 e1 f0
```

3. Send the following plaintext block:

```text id="k2"
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f
```

4. Pulse `uio_in[3]` high to start encryption.
5. Wait for the operation to complete.
6. Read 16 output bytes using the output handshake.

Expected ciphertext:

```text id="k3"
9f c8 4e 35 28 c6 c6 18
55 32 c7 a7 04 64 8b fd
```

### Decryption test

1. Reset the design.
2. Send the same 16-byte key.
3. Send the ciphertext block shown above.
4. Pulse `uio_in[4]` high to start decryption.
5. Read 16 output bytes.

Expected plaintext:

```text id="k4"
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f
```
